Hello! I’m Petra ( @astromorphosis ) 🐸🌈

I've got a bachelor's degree in business IT, and am currently in the process of also getting a bachelor's in computer engineering! 💾

Along with keeping up with my uni courses, I'm trying to learn about computer vision and AI in hopes of eventually developing accessibility apps. 

You can reach me at hellopetrav @ gmail.com !
